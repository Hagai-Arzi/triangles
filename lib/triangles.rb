# the following function return a hash with exactly what we need, using
# less resources. It is a seperated function, because the result can be used
# in different manners.
# [1,3,3] => {1: 1, 3: 2}

# We can use set to check how many different values we have.
# for example - [1,3,3] will give us (1,3) and the count - 2
# is the result.
# This is the simplest lightest and most elegant method for triangles,
# and can be used for other problems as well, but it is less generic then a hash,
# since we doesn't know how many times each value is repeated.
